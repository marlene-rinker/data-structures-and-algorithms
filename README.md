# Reverse an Array
Reverse the contents of an array.

## Challenge
Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

## Approach & Efficiency
Wrote a function that would take in an array, find the length of the array, then starting with the last item, pushes each item into a new array and returns the new array.

# Shift an Array
Add a value to the middle of an array.

## Challenge
Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

## Approach & Efficiency
Wrote a function that takes in an array and a value, creates a new array with the array values, finds the middle of the new array, then puts the value into the middle of the new array and returns the new array.

# Array Binary Search
Search for a value in an array, return index of element if there, return -1 if not there.

## Challenge
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

## Approach & Efficiency
Wrote a function that takes in an array and a value, searches for the value in the array. If the value is there, returns the index of the element. If the value isn't there, returns -1.
