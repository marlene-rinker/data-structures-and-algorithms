# Reverse an Array
Reverse the contents of an array.

## Challenge
Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

## Approach & Efficiency
Wrote a function that would take in an array, find the length of the array, then starting with the last item, pushes each item into a new array and returns the new array.

# Shift an Array
Add a value to the middle of an array.

## Challenge
Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

## Approach & Efficiency
Wrote a function that takes in an array and a value, creates a new array with the array values, finds the middle of the new array, then puts the value into the middle of the new array and returns the new array.
